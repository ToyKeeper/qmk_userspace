## Changes

*2025-12-09*

- Updated to QMK External Userspace, and published a new repository.
- Changed a few things across all my layouts, based on the last couple years of
  use and learning more about what works for me.  Like, Moon-tap is now a mouse
  left click instead of MoonLock.  Macro play/record keys were rearranged a bit
  to make them a little more ergonomic.  And I'm trying a numpad-shaped number
  layer now instead of homerow numbers, because I never used the homerow
  numbers.
- Rewrote this readme and moved most of it to the repo root dir.

*2023-03-15*

- First published version.
